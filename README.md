# Tanzanian Waterwells Project

## Overview  
The **Tanzanian Waterwells Project** is an initiative aimed at predicting water pump functionality to ensure clean water access for the people of Tanzania. This project utilizes **machine learning (ML)** techniques to classify water wells as **functional, non-functional, or in need of repair**. By leveraging data analysis and model optimization, our goal is to provide the people of Tanzania a ML model that can make accurate predictions on water pumps that are functional and produce clean water.

## Team  
- **Shefat Moral**  
- **Gabriel Santorelli**  
- **David Jimenez**  

## Project Goals  
- Our goal for this project was to build an effective ML model that can predict water pump functionality for the purpose of bringing clean water to the people of Tanzania ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿.

## Data Exploration (EDA)  
### Key Findings:  
- The dataset contained **three well statuses**:  
  - **Functional**  
  - **Non-Functional**  
  - **Functional Needs Repair**  
- **Functionality by Region:** Analyzed geographic patterns of well status.  
- **Water Quality Analysis:** Functioning wells did not always provide clean water.  
  - Categories like **Unknown, Fluoride Abandoned, and Salty** were among the lowest quality.

## Model Development  
### **Baseline Model: Decision Tree**  
- Initial accuracy: **75%**  
- Strengths: Identified **Class 0 (Functional)** and **Class 2 (Non-Functional)** well.  
- Weakness: Struggled with **Class 1 (Needs Repair)**.
- Class Balancing: Addressed class imbalance with **class_weight** and **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**. 

### **Improved Model: Random Forest**  
- Initial accuracy: **79%**  
- Improved precision for **Class 1 (60%)** and **Class 2 (84%)**.  
- Struggled to distinguish **Class 1 from Class 2**.
- Further EDA to determine the next steps in optimization.

### **Feature Engineering & Model Optimization**  
- **Correlating Features:** Engineered features based on relationships (e.g., **gps_height, function_years**).  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusted parameters for better classification performance.
- **Error Analysis:** looked into the features that were potentially causing false positives.
 

### **Final Model Performance**  
- **Optimized Random Forest Model**  
  - **Error Analysis:** Pumps that needed repair weren't producing good water. Grouped Needs Repair with Not functional.
  - **Accuracy:** up to **81%**, that's a 6% increase from our baseline model(75%).
  - **Precision:** up to **.82**, that's a 36% increase from our baseline model(.46).
  - **Recall:** up to **.74**, that's a 42% increase from our baseline model(.32).
  - **F1-Score:** up to **.78**, that's a 40% increase from our baseline model(.38).
  - **Reduced false positives by 200 cases.**
  - **Mean CV Accuracy:** .793, indicating there is no overfitting or data leakage.
  - **Standard deviation:** of **0.0025**, indicating model stability.

## Future Improvements  
- **Continue Error Analysis:** Keep exploring features that are causing false positives.
- **Explore additional models:** Like SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc., to enhance the accuracy of the model further.
